Introduction to HTML:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. It is a markup language, which means that it is used to structure and define the content of a webpage.
For example, to create a heading, you would use the <h1> tag, like this:
<code><h1>This is a heading</h1></code>
Basic HTML structure and syntax:
Every HTML document must have a basic structure, which includes the <code><html>, <head> and <body> tags.</code>
The <html> tag indicates the start of an HTML document, while the <code><head> and <body> </code>tags define the head and body of the document, respectively.
For example, a basic HTML structure would look like this:

<code>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a webpage title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html></code>
Common HTML tags and their uses:
Some common HTML tags and their uses include:
<h1> to <h6> for headings
<p> for paragraphs
<a> for links
<img> for images
<ul> and <li> for unordered lists
<ol> and <li> for ordered lists
For example, to create an unordered list, you would use the <ul> and <li> tags, like this:
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


Creating and structuring a basic webpage:
Using the basic structure and common tags, you can create and structure a basic webpage.
For example, a simple webpage with a heading, a paragraph, and an image might look like this:

<code>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Simple Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage created using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A sample image">
  </body>
</html>
</code>
